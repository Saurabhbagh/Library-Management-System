 Welcome to the Assignment!

# Below you will see a basic architecture of the LMS that has been created.

# Database VS Dictionary
Though the input system has the ability to traverse through a CSV file, a simple input has been taken into consideration as more or less it will be connected to a database. This feature has been enabled to showcase the prototype.

# See a preview of the application 
To see a preview of the application you can unzip HowTo Run Test Cases.zip and Steps for Checking Functionality.zip files. 


# Run the file 
1. Download the folder
2. Open the folder Final Build and open the LMS.exe file to run the application



# Running the Test Case is simple 

1. Double click the file and enter an arbitrary User ID or name, there is no type checking done on this and it depends on the current user Instance, and click on submit.
2. Check for test Cases: after each test case is done there is a buffer of 1 second.
* > Check for an empty database
* > Check for someData in the database
* > Checking if we can add  a book
* > Show the book that the user has
* > Removing the book from the user DB
* > show the books Library has after the data has been removed
* > try adding the same book twice
